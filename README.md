# Dummy blockchain implementation

A dummy implementation of blockchain with Python

I've followed the steps from this Medium article 'Learn Blockchains by Building One' https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46

## How to start

1. Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed
2. Run `python3 blockchain.py`
